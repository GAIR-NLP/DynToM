    "answer": "To answer the question, we need to analyze how Melissa's intention influences her actions in Scenario 3:\n\n1. **Scenario Recap**:\n    - Melissa expresses uncertainty about continuing with the project.\n    - Her primary reason is that she wants to focus on her own goals.\n    - Jerry responds with understanding and offers her time to decide.\n\n2. **Melissa's Intention**:\n    - Melissa's intention is to focus on her own personal goals. This is clearly stated in her dialogue: \"I need to focus on my own goals.\"\n    - Her intention reflects a conflict between participating in the group project and pursuing her individual ambitions.\n\n3. **Melissa's Actions**:\n    - Based on her intention to prioritize her own goals, Melissa considers withdrawing from the project.\n    - Her action is influenced by her feeling of needing to concentrate on her personal objectives rather than commit to the group project.\n\n4. **Options Analysis**:\n    - **a. Her intention to prove others wrong leads her to isolate herself and study more intensely.**\n        - This option does not apply as her primary reason isn't about proving others wrong but focusing on personal goals.\n\n    - **b. Her commitment results in active participation in the project.**\n        - This option is incorrect because she is considering withdrawing, not actively participating.\n\n    - **c. Feeling conflicted and frustrated makes her consider withdrawing.**\n        - This option is likely; Melissa feels conflicted about her priorities, which leads her to contemplate withdrawing.\n\n    - **d. Her newfound intention makes her agree to work on a group project.**\n        - This is not applicable because she is leaning towards withdrawing, not agreeing to participate.\n\n    - **e. Her consideration to withdraw results in her asking Jerry for more time.**\n        - This option is closely aligned; she does ask for more time, indicating her consideration to withdraw.\n\n    - **f. Melissa\u2019s belief that the project might hinder her plans causes frustration.**\n        - This is possible but not as clearly displayed in her action of discussing her need to focus on her own goals.\n\nAfter analyzing each option, the most fitting one seems to be c. \n\n**Answer: c. Feeling conflicted and frustrated makes her consider withdrawing.**",

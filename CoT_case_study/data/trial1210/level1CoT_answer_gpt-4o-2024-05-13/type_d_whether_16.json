It's a chance to learn and grow.\"\n- **Melissa**: \"You know what, Jerry? You're right. I'm in. Let's make this project a success.\"\n\nIn scenario 4, Melissa decides to team up with Jerry and participate in the project, thus committing to collaboration.\n\n**Scenario 5:**\n- **Melissa**: \"Jerry, I'm glad we teamed up. It's been more rewarding than I imagined.\"\n- **Jerry**: \"I'm happy to hear that, Melissa. Maybe we can work on more projects together in the future?\"\n- **Melissa**: \"Absolutely! Let's keep this collaboration going.\"\n\nIn scenario 5, Melissa expresses gratitude for the teamwork and shows enthusiasm for continuing to collaborate on future projects.\n\n**Analysis:**\n1. In scenario 4, Melissa makes the initial decision to join Jerry on the project.\n2. In scenario 5, Melissa reflects positively on her experience and looks forward to further collaboration.\n\n**Comparing the actions:**\n- In scenario 4, Melissa's action centers on making the decision to join the project.\n- In scenario 5, Melissa's action shifts to expressing satisfaction with the teamwork and showing interest in future collaborations.\n\nGiven this analysis, the correct interpretation of her actions changing is:\n- From actively deciding to join and participate in the project (Scenario 4), to appreciating the collaboration and proposing to continue it beyond the current project (Scenario 5).\n\nThus, the correct option is:\n\n**a. Yes, from She starts actively participating and contributing ideas. to She thanks Jerry and proposes to continue collaborating outside of school projects.**\n\nSo the answer is **a**.",

It's a chance to learn and grow.\"\n- **Melissa**: \"You know what, Jerry? You're right. I'm in. Let's make this project a success.\"\n\nHere, Melissa is convinced by Jerry that teaming up will be beneficial for her. She decides to join the project, indicating a shift from a potential initial skepticism or self-reliance to recognizing the value of teamwork.\n\n### Scenario 5 Analysis\n- **Melissa**: \"Jerry, I'm glad we teamed up.

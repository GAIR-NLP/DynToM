We're here if you change your mind.\"\n\nIn this scenario, Melissa is uncertain about continuing with the group project, indicating that she might be feeling conflicted, anxious, and possibly overwhelmed as she contemplates prioritizing her goals.\n\n**Scenario 4**:\n- Jerry: \"Melissa, teaming up could help you more than you think. It's a chance to learn and grow.\"\n- Melissa: \"You know what, Jerry? You're right. I'm in.

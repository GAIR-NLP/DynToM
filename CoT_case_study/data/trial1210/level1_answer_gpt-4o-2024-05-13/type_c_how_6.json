    "answer": "In scenario 1, Melissa Decker is concerned that people might not believe she will succeed, which indicates an underlying insecurity and a lack of confidence in her own abilities. Her statement, \"Hey Jerry, do you think people really believe I won't succeed?\" shows that she is seeking validation and reassurance from Jerry. This insecurity and belief that others doubt her capabilities can make Melissa anxious. Jerry's response, \"I don't know why you're so hard on yourself, Melissa. You have so much potential,\" offers her that reassurance, which might temporarily alleviate her anxiety but doesn't change the fundamental belief she holds about herself.\n\nTherefore, Melissa's belief that others doubt her abilities makes her anxious.\n\nThe correct option is: d.",

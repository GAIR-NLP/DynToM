    "answer": "Melissa Decker's belief changes from Scenario 1 to Scenario 2 primarily because of Jerry's reassurance and positive interaction with her. In Scenario 1, Melissa is feeling insecure about her potential, questioning other people's belief in her success. Jerry's supportive comment in Scenario 1 (\"You have so much potential\") starts to alter her negative self-perception. By Scenario 2, Jerry's offer to include her in the group project shows her that he values her contributions, making her feel appreciated and more confident. This appreciation and newfound confidence encourage Melissa to take on the opportunity presented, changing her intention from doubting herself to actively participating.\n\nSo, the answer is **b. Jerry\u2019s reassurance boosts confidence**.",

    "answer": "Melissa Decker's action changes from scenario 1 to scenario 2 primarily due to the influence of Jerry's reassurance and positive interaction. In scenario 1, Melissa is questioning whether people believe in her success, showing signs of self-doubt. Jerry provides encouragement by emphasizing her potential. This positive reinforcement makes Melissa feel more appreciated and valued, which boosts her confidence.\n\nIn scenario 2, when Jerry invites her to join a group project, Melissa is more receptive and willing to collaborate. The change in her action is influenced by the reassurance and appreciation she received, which alters her belief in her own abilities and intentions. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\nb. Feeling appreciated changes her intention.",

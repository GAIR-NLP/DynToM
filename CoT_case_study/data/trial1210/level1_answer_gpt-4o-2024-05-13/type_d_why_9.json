    "answer": "Melissa Decker starts off in Scenario 1 expressing doubt about her ability to succeed, questioning if people genuinely don't believe in her. Jerry's response is supportive, emphasizing her potential and worth. Jerry's reassurance in Scenario 1 does not immediately change Melissa's intention, as she is still harboring doubts about her capabilities.\n\nIn Scenario 2, Jerry invites Melissa to join a group project. Here, Melissa decides to consider the opportunity, expressing gratitude for Jerry's thoughtfulness. This indicates a shift in her mindset - from doubt and self-criticism to being open to new possibilities. Jerry\u2019s support and invitation help her see herself as a valuable contributor, which alters her intention toward collaboration.\n\nTherefore, the change in Melissa's intention is primarily driven by Jerry's reassurance boosting her confidence and feeling appreciated for being included in the group project.\n\nAnswer: e",

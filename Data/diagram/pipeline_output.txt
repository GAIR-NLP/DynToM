The graph above is a diagram of social relationships, where each point represents a person, and each person has a profession. 
###
The following are the members of each family:
[{0: 'father', 1: 'child', 2: 'mother'}, {8: 'child', 13: 'mother', 14: 'father'}, {3: 'husband', 4: 'wife'}, {6: 'wife', 5: 'husband'}, {9: 'husband', 10: 'wife'}, {12: 'husband', 7: 'wife'}, {11: 'alone'}]
###
The available professions include(some professions may not be used, and you can use other professions if needed): 
['priest', 'policeman', 'doctor', 'nurse', 'teller', 'office worker(white-collar worker)', 'factory worker(blue collar worker)', 'teacher', 'student', 'coach', 'cashier', 'lifeguard', 'cook', 'waiter/waitress']
###
Please assign a profession to each individual, ensuring that the distribution of professions reflects a typical societal structure and can accommodate the relationships in the given graph. This task should be completed in three steps:
Step 1: Provide a plausible distribution of professions.
Step 2: Explain in detail: how you can assign professions to conform to the relationships in the given graph. 
Step 3: Assign the professions to each individual. Present the result of Step 3 in JSON format (avoid including additional information such as annotations) and enclose it in a json code block. For example:
```json
{
    "0":"profession of 0",
    "1":"profession of 1",
    ...
}
```

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Step 1: Plausible Distribution of Professions
Based on the given roles within the families and the typical societal structure where a range of professions from various sectors is common, we can distribute the professions among the individuals as follows:

- **Family 1 (0, 1, 2)**: Reflect a balanced family structure, possibly middle-class.
- **Family 2 (8, 13, 14)**: May reflect a similar structure but with different professions to show societal diversity.
- **Other Families** (3, 4), (5, 6), (9, 10), and (12, 7): Couples with possible connections through their professions or social interactions.
- **Individual 11**: As 'alone', a profession that might fit into a more solitary or independent role.

### Step 2: Assigning Professions Based on Relationships
- **Family 1 (0, 1, 2)**: Given the structure father, child, mother, traditional roles such as a factory worker, student, and nurse can be assigned, reflecting a working-class family setup.
- **Family 2 (8, 13, 14)**: To show variety, professional roles such as a doctor (father), a teacher (mother), and a student (child) can be chosen, reflecting a more white-collar family.
- **Couple (3, 4)**: As a husband and wife, assigning one as a white-collar worker (office worker) and the other in a health or service role (waiter/waitress) can illustrate different yet connected societal roles.
- **Couple (5, 6)**: Reflecting another aspect of society, one could be a blue-collar worker (cashier) and the other in a different sector (cook).
- **Couple (9, 10)**: To differ from others, perhaps more civic roles like a policeman (husband) and a nurse (wife).
- **Couple (12, 7)**: With one being a teacher and the other possibly a coach, reflecting an educational and active lifestyle.
- **Individual 11**: A profession like a priest seems apt for a solitary role, suggesting a more spiritual and independent life.

### Step 3: Assigned Professions
The following JSON block represents the professions assigned to each individual based on the steps above:

```json
{
    "0": "factory worker",
    "1": "student",
    "2": "nurse",
    "3": "office worker",
    "4": "waitress",
    "5": "cashier",
    "6": "cook",
    "7": "coach",
    "8": "student",
    "9": "policeman",
    "10": "nurse",
    "11": "priest",
    "12": "teacher",
    "13": "doctor",
    "14": "teacher"
}
```
This distribution attempts to showcase a variety of professions across different sectors, reflecting societal diversity and the interactions potentially expected in such a graph of relationships.

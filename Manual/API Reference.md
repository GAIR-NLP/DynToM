  Return
  
  - A map matrix starting from 0, map_matrix(x, y) is a string list containing all types of (x, y)
  - Offset coordinates for mapping the coordinates into position in Unity
  - A dictionary mapping type string to coordinates.

- ```python
  def get_surrounding(self, uid: int, y_extent: int, x_extent: int, ban_list: Optional[List[str]] = ["obstacle"]) -> List[List[Union[str, int]]]
  ```

navigate = Navigate(map_name = "Map")
```

**Methods**

- ```python
  async def __call__(self, uid: int, end: Union[int, str, Tuple[int, int]]) -> None
  ```

  Navigate in Unity for uid. Destination(end) can be specified as an ID, a name, or a coordinate tuple.

  ```

  Retrieve chat from the MongoDB database according to the provided parameters.

- ```python
  async def distribute_chat(self, from_uid: int, to_uid: int, content: str) -> None
  ```

  Distribute a chat to the to_uid. NPCManager handles the distribution of the message.

These scenarios include dialogue and the background of the dialogue between one main characters and other characters. 3. These scenarios are to test the theory of mind reasoning abilities of four mental states: belief, emotion, intention, action. 4. In some research theories, the belief will influence emotion, the emotion will influence intention, and the intention will influence action. 5. One scenario only to reflect 1-2 dimension(s) of belief, emotion, intention, and action. 6. One scenario will influence the following scenarios.7. I want you to extract some questions from these scenarios to test if the readers have the theory of mind reasoning abilities.8. These questions are multi-choices questions, you should provide the options and the answer for every question.9. These question can directly ask about the belief, emotion, intention, and action about the main character. This kind of question is relatively easy. Beside the easy kind questions, you should also provide questions that are harder: how one type of mental states influence the following mental states (how the mental states in one scenario influence the mental states in the following scenarios)10. For every scenario, you should provide questions about: a)what the belief is, what the emotion is, what the intention is, and what the action is; b) if the current mental states are changed compared with the previous mental states; c) if mental states changed, why the mental states changed; d) how the mental states in all previous scenarios influence the mental states in the current scenario.11. You don't have to express you understanding of the theory of mind reasoning abilities in the questions. You just need to provide the questions.The input story is:"

You can also generate some trap questions. for example: if one mental states do not change, you can ask why the mental states change; but in fact, the mental states do not change; so the true answer is that the mental states do not change."

Generalizing (understanding of sentences). Mainly refers to replacing the whole with the part, replacing the whole with the part; or replacing the part with the whole, and replacing the individual with the general.Therefore, add modifiers and restrictive words before important words, such as 'some', 'almost','except...', 'until...', 'most', 'all', etc. b. Making something out of nothing (screening and integration of information). It means that the content mentioned in the given options is not involved in the original material and cannot be inferred from the original text. c. Putting the wrong hat on the wrong head (concept). Mainly refers to deliberately mistaking the object in the options to confuse the reader. d. Cause and effect confusion. There are generally two situations of cause and effect confusion: one is the reversal of cause and effect, that is, misjudging 'cause' as 'effect' and 'effect' as 'cause', reversing the relationship between the two; the other is imposing cause and effect, that is, saying that there is no causal relationship as a causal relationship. e. Reversing the main and the secondary. The changes and developments of things have major and minor contradictions in terms of contradictions, major and minor causes in terms of causes, and major and minor aspects in terms of manifestations. When designing traps, these 'major' and 'minor' aspects are reversed. f. Confusing time. Calling things that have not yet been determined or realized in the original text as fait accompli. g. Information omission. When setting a 'trap', the questioner deliberately omits essential information in the original text, resulting in incomplete information. h. Misinterpretation of the original meaning. It means that the understanding of words and sentences deviates from the original meaning, misinterpreting the original text's point of view or meaning to be expressed.i. Unclear reference. It means that the reference content of the pronoun is vague, unclear, or even wrong. j. Logical error. It mainly refers to the questioner setting traps from the perspective of logical reasoning when setting options for reasonable inferences and imagination questions based on the original content. There are two ways to ask logical error types.First, the conditions are insufficient.Second, the necessary conditions are regarded as sufficient and necessary conditions.k. Answering irrelevant questions. This means that the options are completely irrelevant to the question stem, and the answer is detached from the question.l. Quoting out of context.m. Substituting concepts"

These scenarios include dialogue and the background of the dialogue between one main characters and other characters. 3. These scenarios are to test the theory of mind reasoning abilities of four mental states: belief, emotion, intention, action. 4. In some research theories, the belief will influence emotion, the emotion will influence intention, and the intention will influence action. 5. One scenario only to reflect 1-2 dimension(s) of belief, emotion, intention, and action. 6. One scenario will influence the following scenarios.7. I want you to extract some questions from these scenarios to test if the readers have the theory of mind reasoning abilities.8. These questions are multi-choices questions, you should provide the options and the answer for every question.9. These question can directly ask about the belief, emotion, intention, and action about the main character. This kind of question is relatively easy. Beside the easy kind questions, you should also provide questions that are harder: how one type of mental states influence the following mental states (how the mental states in one scenario influence the mental states in the following scenarios)10. For every scenario, you should provide questions about: a)what the belief is, what the emotion is, what the intention is, and what the action is; b) if the current mental states are changed compared with the previous mental states; c) if mental states changed, why the mental states changed; d) how the mental states in all previous scenarios influence the mental states in the current scenario.11. You don't have to express you understanding of the theory of mind reasoning abilities in the questions. You just need to provide the questions.The input story is:"
